## Self-Reflection:

I struggled a lot with this assignment compared to previous assignments. I did a lot of troubleshooting and Stackoverflow reading, as well as reaching out to classmates for assistance. I think the tools used in this assignment were really cool and I'd love to see what a completed version looks like, but I'm stuck receiving a network error and am at the end of my wits on figuring out what has caused it. I thought I solved it by changing the link for the word retrieval but it's still there. It also looks like based on Network logs that the difficulty was not being passed into the retrieval URL, but it looks like it should still fetch a word anyway. I'm a bit dissapointed to leave this unfinished, but it appears to be as far as I can get it.

### How long it took me to finish this?
